# WATS2020: Professional Practice

This repository is where you will do your work for WATS2020: Professional Practice. Throughout this course we will break into groups and work through several assignments where you will simulate a web production environment. This will involve coming up with requirements, user stories, estimating sizes, prioritizing work, and then actually completing some work and collaborating together using branches and pull requests.

The point of these assignments, and this repository, **is not** to train serious technical skills or the "buttonology" of Github. Although we will be using a workflow that is designed for use with Github and similar tools, the general principles of effective communication and collaboration are the most important to learn. The tools we use will evolve and change over time, but the basic goal of working together in an effective and efficient way remains.
